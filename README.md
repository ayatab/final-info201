## Overview

Final project in INFO-201 with Lisa Benjamin, Ayata Bernhardt, Mitchell Stapelman, and Justin Tham.
This project works with the shiny framework to build an interactive application using R. This app has different files for the UI and Server. 


## Data

This application uses data from the U.S Census, Our World in Data and the CDC for visualizations on income, national COVID-19 and vaccine reporting as well as political tendencies.

The app includes a introduction page that briefly describes our different tabs along with a conclusion page on our observations from the data we worked with.
